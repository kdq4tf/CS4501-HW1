        <h2>What is a Password Generator?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">
            A <b>password generator</b> is a tool that creates unique passwords.
            It is often used in partnership with a password management solution, allowing you to create strong secure
            passwords and store them in a digital vault. In turn, this also frees you from the task of having
            to memorize any credentials except for your master password.

        <h2>Still Confused? Learn What a Password Generator Is!</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            A <b>password generator</b> is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users.
            It helps users create strong passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <b>password generator</b> is a tool that creates random passwords for you.
            These utilities make the password creation process much easier by preventing you from making common mistakes.
            The most important thing to remember about password generators is that they don't store any passwords.
            Instead, they create long strings of random characters that are highly difficult for humans to remember
            but also challenging to crack.
